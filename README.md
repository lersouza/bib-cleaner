# Bib Cleaner
 
Bib Cleaner is a very simple script which takes an LaTeX source file and multiple BibTex files and produces a new BibTex file containing only used references.

To run it, type:

```sh
python3 bib_cleaner.py [main_latex_file] [bib_file1 bib_fil2 ... bib_filen] > new_bib.bib
```

The goal here is to remove unused references.

If you find any issue with this script, please post a Issue on this Github Repo.
